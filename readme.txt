Instructions:

Before running any of the models:
1. generate data by running generate_data.m
2. generate the selected features by running feature_selection.m

To run logistic regression model run logistic_regression.m
sample output:
   7.3734e-04

       85271          23
          40         108

    0.9993

Precision for label 0: 9.995311e-01
Precision for label 1: 8.244275e-01
Recall for label 0: 9.997303e-01
Recall for label 1: 7.297297e-01

The first number is the error rate: ie  7.3734e-04
The matrix is the confusion matrix
next is the accuracy: ie 0.9993

To run SVM run SVM.m

To run neural network run neural_network.m

To run k-means run km.m

To run fcm run main_partII_FCM.m

If you want to display the graphs, uncomment its that part of code.
